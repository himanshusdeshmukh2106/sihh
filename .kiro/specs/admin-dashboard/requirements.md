# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive web-based admin dashboard that will allow administrators to manage and analyze all aspects of the sports application. The dashboard will provide data visualization, user management, content moderation, and analytics capabilities across all sports categories. It will be built as a separate React web application that shares the same FastAPI backend with the mobile app.
