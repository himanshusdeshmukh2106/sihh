# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates real-time pushup detection and counting into the SIH fitness assessment app. When users select a sport and press "Start Assessment", the system will launch a pushup-specific assessment module that uses computer vision to detect and count pushup repetitions in real-time. The integration focuses exclusively on pushup exercises, providing a minimal working implementation that can be expanded later.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to perform a pushup assessment after selecting my sport, so that I can get an accurate count of my pushup repetitions using computer vision technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses "Start Assessment" from the SportDetailScreen THEN the system SHALL navigate to a new PushupAssessmentScreen
2. WHEN the PushupAssessmentScreen loads THEN the system SHALL initialize the camera and computer vision components
3. WHEN the user is in proper pushup position THEN the system SHALL detect and display real-time feedback
4. WHEN the user completes a valid pushup repetition THEN the system SHALL increment the counter by 1
5. WHEN the assessment is complete THEN the system SHALL display the total count and save the results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want real-time visual feedback during my pushup assessment, so that I know the system is tracking my movements correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera is active THEN the system SHALL display a live camera feed with overlay graphics
2. WHEN a pushup is detected THEN the system SHALL provide visual confirmation (e.g., green indicator, animation)
3. WHEN the user's form is incorrect THEN the system SHALL provide visual guidance feedback
4. WHEN the rep counter updates THEN the system SHALL display the current count prominently on screen
5. IF the user is not in frame or positioned incorrectly THEN the system SHALL display positioning guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to control my pushup assessment session, so that I can start, pause, and complete my workout when ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PushupAssessmentScreen loads THEN the system SHALL display a "Start Assessment" button
2. WHEN the user presses "Start Assessment" THEN the system SHALL begin real-time pushup detection
3. WHEN the assessment is active THEN the system SHALL provide "Pause" and "Stop" controls
4. WHEN the user presses "Pause" THEN the system SHALL pause detection while maintaining the current count
5. WHEN the user presses "Stop" or completes the session THEN the system SHALL navigate to a results screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want to see my pushup assessment results, so that I can track my performance and progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the assessment is completed THEN the system SHALL display total repetitions counted
2. WHEN the results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show assessment duration
3. WHEN the results are displayed THEN the system SHALL provide options to save or retake the assessment
4. WHEN the user chooses to save THEN the system SHALL store the results with timestamp and user profile
5. WHEN the user chooses to retake THEN the system SHALL return to the PushupAssessmentScreen with reset counters

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a fitness app user, I want the pushup detection to work reliably on my mobile device, so that I get accurate counts without technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app initializes camera permissions THEN the system SHALL request and handle camera access appropriately
2. WHEN the device has limited processing power THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable performance (>15 FPS)
3. WHEN lighting conditions are suboptimal THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to improve detection accuracy
4. IF the camera fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL display an error message and fallback options
5. WHEN the app is backgrounded during assessment THEN the system SHALL pause detection and preserve current state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a fitness app developer, I want to integrate only pushup detection from the external repository, so that we have a focused and maintainable implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating the external exercise detection code THEN the system SHALL include only pushup-related components
2. WHEN the integration is complete THEN the system SHALL NOT include jumping jacks, sit-ups, or other exercise detection
3. WHEN the pushup detection model is loaded THEN the system SHALL use minimal memory and processing resources
4. WHEN the code is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing app architecture and navigation patterns
5. IF the external dependencies conflict with existing packages THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts with minimal impact
