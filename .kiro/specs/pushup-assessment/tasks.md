- [x] 4. Implement core pushup detection engine


  - Adapt the pushup detection algorithm from SIH-Exercises repository for React Native
  - Create PushupDetectionEngine service class with initialize, start, pause, stop methods
  - Implement pose detection using TensorFlow.js with camera frame processing
  - Add pushup counting logic based on body keypoint analysis from the original repository
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 6.4_


- [ ] 5. Add real-time visual feedback and form guidance
  - Implement visual indicators for pushup detection status (green/yellow/red feedback)
  - Add positioning guide overlay to help users align properly with camera
  - Create form validation feedback based on pose analysis from SIH-Exercises detection logic
  - Display real-time pushup counter with smooth animations
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5_

- [x] 6. Implement assessment session controls

  - Add start/pause/stop functionality to the detection engine
  - Implement session timing and state management
  - Create assessment control buttons with proper state handling
  - Add session pause/resume capability while preserving current count
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Create AssessmentResultsScreen for displaying results


  - Create new screen component to display assessment completion results
  - Show total pushup count, session duration, and performance summary
  - Add save/retake options with proper navigation handling
  - Implement results screen UI with clear data presentation
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Implement assessment data persistence


  - Create AssessmentDataService for saving and retrieving assessment sessions
  - Implement local storage using AsyncStorage for assessment history

- [x] 10. Optimize performance and add testing




  - Optimize detection frame rate and memory usage for mobile devices
  - Add performance monitoring to maintain acceptable FPS during detection
  - Create unit tests for PushupDetectionEngine and AssessmentDataService
  - Test integration with various device types and lighting conditions
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 6.5_

- [ ] 11. Polish UI/UX and integrate with existing app flow
  - Ensure consistent design language with existing app components
  - Add proper loading states and smooth transitions between screens
  - Integrate assessment results with existing user profile and progress tracking
  - Add accessibility features and proper screen reader support
  - _Requirements: 1.5, 3.5, 4.4_
