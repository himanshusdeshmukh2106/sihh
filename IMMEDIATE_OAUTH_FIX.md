# IMMEDIATE FIX - OAuth Stuck Issue

## The Real Problem
From your logs, I can see the OAuth URL is generated correctly but gets stuck on the "continue" button. This happens because:

1. **Wrong Supabase Configuration** - The redirect URL format is incorrect
2. **Deep link not triggering** - The app isn't receiving the callback

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Update Supabase Configuration

Go to your Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration and set:

```
Site URL: http://localhost:3000
Additional Redirect URLs:
- com.sihapp://oauth/callback
- exp://192.168.1.4:8081/--/oauth/callback
```

**Why this works:**
- Site URL should be localhost for web fallback
- Additional URLs include both your custom scheme AND the Expo development URL

### Step 2: Test Different Redirect Format

Try this alternative in your Supabase Additional Redirect URLs:
```
- com.sihapp://oauth/callback
- exp://192.168.1.4:8081/--/oauth/callback  
- myapp://oauth/callback
```

### Step 3: Alternative Simple Approach

If the above doesn't work, let's use a simpler redirect:

**Supabase Configuration:**
```
Site URL: com.sihapp://
Additional Redirect URLs:
- com.sihapp://
- exp://192.168.1.4:8081/--/
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Update Supabase configuration** with the URLs above
2. **Restart Expo dev server**: `npx expo start -c`
3. **Try OAuth again**
4. **Watch logs for**:
   - "Browser result:"
   - "Deep link received:" (should show the callback URL with tokens)

## Expected Behavior

After clicking continue, you should see:
1. Browser closes automatically
2. App receives deep link with access_token
3. "OAuth callback detected, processing..."
4. "Authentication successful!"

Try this configuration and let me know what logs you see!
